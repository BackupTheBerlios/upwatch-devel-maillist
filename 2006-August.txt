Subject: [Upwatch-devel] uw_sysstat regex parsing problem
Message-ID: <44D881EA.8070100@nedbsd.nl>

It seems like the regex parsing in uw_sysstat and uwregexp behave
different. Some regexes match fine when creating it in uwregexp but fail
 when loaded by uw_sysstat.

One example:
Aug  8 14:10:01 server-03 sendmail[30290]: k78CA1IR030290:
server-03.server.netland.nl [127.0.0.1] did not issue
MAIL/EXPN/VRFY/ETRN during connection to MTA

In uwregexp
[LOGDATE] sendmail[PID]: [MSGID]: [HOSTNAME] \[[IPADDR]\] did not issue
MAIL/EXPN/VRFY/ETRN during connection to MTA
It matches, but uw_sysstat will give me non-green every time it hits
that log line.

I have been trying to debug this but did not find a solution yet.

Wijnand
